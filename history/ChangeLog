	* README.md: New file, explaining the history of the program
	and the branches in the Git repo.

2001-01-23         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@gnu.org>

	* prepinfo.awk: Update copyright year.
	* prepinfo.texi: New file that documents the program. Originally
	intended for inclusion in the gawk manual, but it was too big
	a section.

2001-01-21         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@gnu.org>

	* prepinfo.awk: Remove #! line. Update email address. Hardwire
	program name instead of ARGV[0]. Skip lines between `@ignore'
	and `@end ignore'. Same for `@detailmenu' and `@end detailmenu'.
	Use `@detailmenu' when printing the master menu.
	(print_menuitem): Remove manual deletion of contents of `dwords'
	array; split() does this for us.

	* prepinfo.awk: Add copyright statement.  Lots of editing in
	comments and improvements to code formatting to avoid too-long
	lines. Remove additional debugging added in version of 1997-06-06.

	Move a few lines up or down for better organization.
	(getnodename): Improve removal of whitespace.
