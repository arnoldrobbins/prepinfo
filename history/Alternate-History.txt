============================

This branch represents a parallel line of development to
the main branch.  I don't know exactly how that happened. :-(

The dates used are the ones in my filesystem, but they're clearly
weird; in particular I doubt that it was as late as 2012 that
I added handling of @detailmenu.

I decided that the best way to represent this parallel line was
to put it in to a separate branch.

Dates from my filesystem:

1993-06-06:	Third version of the script
1998-11-15:	Same + copyright. This was released with Texinfo.
2000-09-05:	Third version, no copyright, added @ignore handling.
2012-11-04:	Same + handling of @detailmenu.

See also the README.md file in this directory.
